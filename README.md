Setup
-----

You'll need a dark room, a video projector, and a webcam.

- Point the video projector to a large wall, connect it to your computer and set it up in a way so that the projector shows an additional screen (and is not mirroring the computer's screen).
- Also point the webcam to the wall, but position it to the side, so that it looks at the wall at an angle. You want people to be able to cast shadows on the wall, without stepping in front of the camera.
- Mark the allowed "playing field" for the players, by putting tape on the floor, or by restricting the field with some pieces of furniture.
- Open `level.html` in your browser, and put it in fullscreen on the projector's screen.
- Open `index.html` in the same browser, and leave it on your computer's screen.
- Click "reset". After taking snapshots of all levels, the game will start! If the levels aren't recognized well, you can play with the "threshold" slider and click "reset" again.
- Clicking "next" will go to the next level.
